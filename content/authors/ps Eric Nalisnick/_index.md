I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Cambridge Machine Learning Group. My research interests lie broadly within probabilistic machine learning and statistics. Of late, I’ve been working on priors for Bayesian neural networks and critiquing deep generative models. I completed my PhD under the supervision of Padhraic Smyth at the University of California, Irvine. I’ve done research internships at DeepMind, Twitter Cortex, Microsoft Research, and Amazon.

I am a postdoctoral researcher and Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellow at the Machine Learning Group, University of Cambridge. I received my PhD from the University of Copenhagen, where I subsequently worked as a postdoc.

The fields of probabilistic machine learning and statistics broadly define my research interests, and I am particularly enthusiastic about models that can realistically estimate the uncertainty on their predictions. Currently, my focus is on Gaussian processes with an emphasis on their deep and multi-output variants as well as approximation methods for these. Addressing environmental challenges, like pollution estimation, is among the goals of my project, [DeepGeo](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/214496_en.html).

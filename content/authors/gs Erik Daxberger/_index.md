Hi there, I am Erik, a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). As a [Cambridge-Tübingen fellow](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=1458), I will also spend a year of my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/) in Tübingen, Germany, at the department led by [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/bs). My research interests broadly revolve around machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a current focus on methods at the intersection of probabilistic modeling and deep learning.

Before embarking on my PhD, I obtained a Master’s degree in Computer Science from [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), where I also did research on discrete and mixed-variable Bayesian optimization with [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea). Prior to that, I was based in my hometown of Munich, Germany, where I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [Ludwigs-Maximilians-Universität](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), and did an internship at [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home.html), working on statistical relational learning with [Volker Tresp](http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/). I also spent a great year at the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/), where I did research on batch Bayesian optimization with [Bryan Kian Hsiang Low](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html).

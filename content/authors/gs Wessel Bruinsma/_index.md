Hey! I am a PhD student at the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Dr Richard Turner, and a member of Christâ€™s College. Previously, I was a machine learning researcher for [Invenia Labs](https://www.invenialabs.co.uk/); they solve problems in the fields of machine learning, finance, electricity systems and markets, and complex systems. Even before that, I was an electrical engineer for the [TU Delft Solar Boat Team](https://www.solarboatteam.nl/en/).

I hold an MPhil in Machine Learning, Speech, and Language Technology from the University of Cambridge and a BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Delft. My curriculum vitae can be found [here](https://wesselb.github.io/assets/cv.pdf).

My research interests include probabilistic modelling, with a focus on Gaussian processes, approximate inference, and signal processing.

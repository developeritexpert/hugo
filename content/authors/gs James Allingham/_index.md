I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/), and a member of Darwin College.
Before starting the PhD, I was a consultant for Wolfram Research where I helped develop the deep learning library for Mathematica.

I hold an MPhil in Advanced Machine Learning from the University of Cambridge, which was supervised by [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) and [Christian Steinruecken](https://q4.github.io/), and a BSc in Electrical and Information Engineering from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

My primary research interests are Bayesian deep learning and deep generative models.

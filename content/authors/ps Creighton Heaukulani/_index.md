I am an American PhD student supervised by Zoubin Ghahramani.  Before coming to Cambridge, I obtained an MA in Statistics from Yale University where I was supervised by Andrew R. Barron and Sekhar Tatikonda.  I obtained a BA in Mathematics from the University of Virginia, and I have also taken Part III of the Maths Tripos here in Cambridge prior to joining the lab.  I am the current Stephen Thomas Scholar at Queensâ€™ College, funded via the Cambridge Trusts.

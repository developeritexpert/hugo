[Daniel](http://danroy.org/) is now an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.

Daniel joined the group in March 2011 as a Newton Fellow, having just completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT.  Daniel’s research interests lie at the intersection of computer science, statistics and probability theory.  His recent work addresses several theoretical questions at the foundation of the emerging field of probabilistic programming in AI and machine learning.  At Cambridge, he has continued to pursue his interests in the complexity of probabilistic inference; representation theorems connecting complexity and probabilistic structures; and the use of recursion to define nonparametric distributions on data structures.

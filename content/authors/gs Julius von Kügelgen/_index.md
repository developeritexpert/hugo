Originally from Hamburg, Germany, Julius studied Mathematics (MSci) at Imperial College London and Artificial Intelligence (MSc) at UPC Barcelona and TU Delft. He joined the [Cambridge-Tübingen programme](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=1458) in October 2018 where he is supervised by [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) in Cambridge and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/bs) at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen. He is funded by a Cambridge-Tübingen PhD fellowship with generous support from Amazon. His research interest include causal inference and its applications to machine learning (e.g., for transfer and reinforcement learning, fairness, and interpretability).

My research interests are in the field of machine learning with an emphasis in linear Bayesian approaches that incorporate the assumption of sparsity. Since November 2009 to September 2011 I worked as postdoc researcher in the [Machine Learning Group](http://www.ucl.ac.be/mlg/) of the [ICTEAM](http://www.uclouvain.be/en-icteam.html) of the Université catholique de Louvain. Specifically, in the research project “Rheumagene”. This project tries to obtain accurate predictors for the early diagnosis of undifferentiated arthritis using low density micro-array data. The project leaders are Prof. Bernard Lauwerys and Prof. [Pierre Dupont](http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pdupont). I am also collaborating with [J.M. Hernández-Lobato](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~jmlobato), [Alberto Suárez](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~asuarez/) and [Gonzalo Martínez-Muñoz](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~gonzalo/) from Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. I participate as a researcher in the project “Advanced Learning on a Large Scale”, funded by the Spanish Minsterio de Educación y Ciencia. This project willl last until 2013.

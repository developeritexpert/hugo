I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge since 2018. I have a broad interest in the field of probabilistic machine learning, especially Bayesian approximate inference methods, Bayesian deep learning, and Gaussian processes. Previously I received BSc in mathematics and a MRes in machine learning and computational statistics (supervised by [Prof. David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php)). I am supervised by [Dr. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/), and my advisor is [Dr. Richard Turner](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php).

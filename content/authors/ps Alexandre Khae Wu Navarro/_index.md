Alexandre is currently a PhD student supervised by Dr. Richard Turner and Dr. Carl Rasmussen. His main research interest lies in the intersection between Directional Statistics and probabilistic Machine Learning, both in fundamental and applied research.

He is also interested in variational methods, causal inference, partially-observed Markov processes (encompassing change-point models).

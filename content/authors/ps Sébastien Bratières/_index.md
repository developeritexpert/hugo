I received my “Ingénieur” degree from Ecole Centrale Paris, and an MPhil in Computer Speech and Language Processing from the University of Cambridge in 2001. I have been working in the speech industry ever since, and started my PhD on a part-time basis in 2009. In my professional life, I am the resident Speech Evangelist at dawin, a German company which produces embedded speech recognition solutions for the logistics industry.

My research area is statistical machine learning. More specifically, I work on non-parametric Bayesian models, and try to implement learning algorithms for them in a distributed fashion (for instance using Hadoop). I am interested in applications to natural language processing, speech recognition, dialogue systems.

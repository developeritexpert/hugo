Alexander G. de G. Matthews
Alex Matthews

I have recently taken up a position as a Research Scientist at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/). This is my old university page.


I am a postdoctoral Research Associate in the University of Cambridge Machine Learning Group. I work with [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) with whom I also completed my PhD. I have done work on Gaussian processes. In the area of approximate Bayesian inference, I have worked on variational methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Most recently, I have worked on probabilistic deep learning.

_A full list of my publications can be found on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3OFgQKcAAAAJ&hl=enhttp://)._

I am one of the founding developers on GPflow a Gaussian process library built on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). I have also contributed C++ linear algebra ops to TensorFlow itself, for which I won a [Google open source software award](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?p=1949).

My doctoral thesis can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.25348).

My GitHub page can be found [here](https://github.com/alexggmatthews). I sometimes [Tweet](https://twitter.com/alexggmatthews) about statistics and machine learning. A recent version of my [CV](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/matthews/AMatthewsCV.pdf) is available.

An introductory level talk for my work on Gaussian processes, for which the slides are [available](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/matthews/microsoftTalk.pdf) can be found [here](http://youtu.be/mfAHrC2xt8A)

As an undergraduate I studied Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, specialising in theoretical physics. My fourth year project, which was later [published](http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v80/i16/e165309), studied scattering in the fractional quantum Hall effect with [Nigel Cooper](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~nrc25/). After that I worked in industry for [Navetas Energy Management](http://www.navetas.com/), a University of Oxford spin-out company which applies machine learning to the problem of home energy disaggregation.

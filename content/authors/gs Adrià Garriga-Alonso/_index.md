I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Carl Edward Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=carl-rasmussen-2). I received an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Oxford, and a BSc in Computer Science from [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/), Barcelona. I am funded by the Department of Engineering.

My work is about model-based reinforcement learning based on Gaussian Processes. I am also interested in the value alignment problem, Bayesian machine learning and handling missing data.

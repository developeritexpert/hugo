Nilesh Tripuraneni graduated from Harvard with a B.A. in Physics. Before joining the Machine Learning Group at Cambridge, he worked at machine learning start-ups in Boston on problems in natural language processing and probabilistic programming. At Cambridge, he is funded by an overseas studentship from Trinity College. He is particularly interested in approximate inference, and Monte Carlo methods but is generally interested in all theoretical topics in machine learning.

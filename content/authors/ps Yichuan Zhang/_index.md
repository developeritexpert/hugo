I am a post-doc researcher working on statistical inference, undirected graphical models, deep generative models and data cleaning related applications. My major theoretical interest of research is focused on the mathematical foundation of machine learning and general intelligent systems. I am also enthusiastic about general probabilistic programming and software systems for industrial machine learning applications.

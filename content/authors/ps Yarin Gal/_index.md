**For my personal web page and publications [please click here](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/).**

 

I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning group supervised by [Prof Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/), and funded by the [Google Europe Doctoral Fellowship](http://research.google.com/university/relations/fellowship_recipients.html). Before arriving at Cambridge I studied at the Computer Science department at Oxford for a Masterâ€™s degree under the supervision of [Dr Phil Blunsom](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/phil.blunsom/). In my research at Oxford I worked on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, and in particular on Machine Translation and the development of new word alignment models.

Prior to my MSc I worked as a software engineer for 3 years at IDesia Biometrics developing code and UI for mobile platforms. I did my undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science at the Open University in Israel, where I worked on Computational Biology and Game Theory as a fourth year project.

My interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Bayesian non-parametrics. My current research covers Scalable Models for Compositional Semantics, Compositional Distributional Models of Semantics, and Machine Translation; Coagulation Fragmentation processes, foundations of Bayesian non-parametrics, and Probabilistic Logic Learning.

I am a member of Gonville and Caius College.

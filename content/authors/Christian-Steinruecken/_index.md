I am a post-doctoral researcher in machine learning, working with Prof Zoubin Ghahramani on the [Automatic Statistician Project](https://www.automaticstatistician.com/).

I am a member of [Kingâ€™s College](http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/), at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/).

My academic interests are broadly spread across machine learning and artificial intelligence, and include topics in information theory (such as error correction and data compression), probabilistic programming, automated model construction, and computation theory. I built an [Inverse Calculator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsJmtpzJljQ), and a self-learning guessing game AI called Sensipede.

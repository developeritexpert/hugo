I received the Ingenierio de Telecomuniacion and Doctor Ingeniero de Telecomunicacion both from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain, in 1988 and 1992, respectively. I have been Associate Professor at Universidad de Vigo, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, and Universidad de Alcalá, and since 2002 I am a Professor at the Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I am currently on a sabbatical leave.

My research interests include signal processing, machine learning, and information theory methods, and its application to sensor networks, communications, and medical applications.

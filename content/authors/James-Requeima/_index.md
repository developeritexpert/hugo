I’m a PhD student studying machine learning at the University of Cambridge in the Computational and Biological Learning Lab. My advisor is Dr. Richard Turner. I’m interested in meta-learning, neural processes, approximate inference methods and Bayesian optimization.

I was recently a visiting student at MILA under the supervision of Yoshua Bengio.

Previously, I completed a Master’s in machine learning, speech and language technology at the University of Cambridge where my advisor was Dr. Zoubin Ghahramani.
Invenia

I’m also a researcher at Invenia Technical Computing based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. We use machine learning techniques to forecast demand for power in the electricity grid, energy production from wind farms, and electricity prices in wholesale power markets. I helped set up our research offices in Montréal, Canada and Cambridge, England.

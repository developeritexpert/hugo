My personal webpage has moved. You may now find [Gintare Karolina Dziugaite‘s](https://gkdz.org/) page here.

I am a member of King’s College and joined Zoubin Ghahramani’s group in Spring 2014 as a PhD student. Before that, I studied Mathematics at Warwick University and read Part III in Mathematics at Cambridge, receiving a Masters in Advanced Studies in Applied Mathematics. My PhD is funded by the EPSRC. My research interests include deep learning, generative models, and learning theory.

See my [curriculum vitae](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B97F2eFg4l-XemxkRTRGemxBZnc/view?usp=sharing) for more details.

During Winter 2017, I was a long-term participant in the Foundations of Machine Learning program at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at the University of Berkeley.

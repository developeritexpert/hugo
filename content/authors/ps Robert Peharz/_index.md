I am a Research Associate in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge, working with Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani. I am generally interested in the wide field of probabilistic modeling, as this is arguably the approach to reason under uncertain knowledge. In particular, I am interested in methods which aim to strike a sensible balance between expressiveness and tractability in probabilistic modeling, such as sum-product networks.

I started my PhD in October 2012 in the Machine Learning group and am supervised by [Carl Rasmussen](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/). In 2008, I moved from the Netherlands to Cambridge to study Engineering. In 2012, I received the MEng degree, specialising in Information and Computer Engineering. I am funded by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Award and am a member of Jesus College.

I’m a PhD student supervised by Adrian Weller and advised by José Miguel Hernández-Lobato (started in October 2019, Sidney Sussex College). I am funded by the Department of Engineering and Trust Scholarship. Before entering a PhD program I’ve received a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Ural Federal University (2017, Yekaterinburg, Russia) and Master’s degree in Statistical Learning Theory from Skoltech & HSE (2019, Moscow, Russia). In addition, I’ve graduated from Yandex School of Data Analysis (2017)—a two-year machine learning program which is well known and respectable in Russia. My work experience includes a part-time software engineer position at SKB Kontur in 2016-2017 and a number of summer internships – SKB Kontur (summer 2015), Google Summer of Code (summer 2016), Google UK Ltd (summer 2017), Samsung AI Center Moscow (summer 2018).

As for my research interests, I would indicate statistical machine learning and scalable machine learning algorithms.

Alessandro completed a BA in Philosophy before moving on to a Master’s degree in Machine Learning at UCL. Continuing the work of his Master’s thesis, he spent one year at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit working with Professor Sahani on latent variable dynamical systems.
Prior to joining the Cambridge-Tübingen Machine Learning group in October 2016, he worked as a Data Scientist at a London startup.
His research interests lie in time-series analysis (especially state-space models), reinforcement learning and approximate inference methods.
He is funded by the Cambridge-Tübingen Fellowship and the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship.

**NEWS:** Starting May 2017,  I will join the [Oxford-Man Institute](http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Department of Engineering Science](http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/) at [Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) as a Senior Research Fellow.

From November 2014-April 2017 I was a research associate at the Engineering Department at the University of Cambridge.
Predominantly working at the intersection of machine learning and control, I am a joint member of both the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) and the [Control Group](http://www-control.eng.cam.ac.uk/).

I was working within the Autonomous and Intelligent Systems Partnership (AISP) and am grateful for having received funding from EPSRC and Schlumberger. Furthermore, I have been working in the area of computational mechanism design and am grateful for an award in support of this work from EPSRC-NCSML.

Congratulations to David Knowles for winning this year’s Lindley Prize for his paper “Fixed-Form Variational Posterior Approximation through Stochastic Linear Regression”.  The prize is awarded every four years by the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA).  From the IBSA homepage: “Award winning papers will present research in Bayesian statistics that is is judged important, timely and notably original; truly innovative work will be judged more highly than successful development of ideas previously exposed.”

[Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) and [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) are involved with the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) which was launched this week.

[Professor Stephen Hawking](http://www.hawking.org.uk/) gave a widely reported [speech](https://www.facebook.com/cambridgenews/videos/10154135197908031/?pnref=story) at the launch.

Zoubin, who introduced the talk, is the Deputy Director of the Centre.

Adrian is an Executive Fellow at the centre and is leading the project on Trust and Transparency, which is part of his general interest in the social implications of AI.

[Professor Magaret Boden](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/276), who also spoke, said:

>_AI is hugely exciting. Its practical applications can help us to tackle important social problems, as well as easing many tasks in everyday life. And it has advanced the sciences of mind and life in fundamental ways. But it has limitations, which present grave dangers given uncritical use. CFI aims to pre-empt these dangers, by guiding AI development in human-friendly ways._

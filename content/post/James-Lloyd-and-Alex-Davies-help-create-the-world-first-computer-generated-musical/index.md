MLG alumni [Dr James Robert Lloyd](http://jamesrobertlloyd.com/) and [Dr Alex Davies](http://www.alexdavies.net/) have helped create the world’s first musical largely created by computer, in work which began whilst they were in Cambridge. Together with [Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/Dept/People/Spiegelhalter/davids.html) they began by analysing factors associated with success and failure in musical theatre. This analysis was then used to guide the creation of content for the musical, including using a recurrent neural network language model trained on musical theatre lyrics.

The musical, Beyond the Fence, will be showing at the Arts Theatre in London’s West End from 22nd February to 5th March. Full details can be found [here](http://beyondthefencemusical.com/).

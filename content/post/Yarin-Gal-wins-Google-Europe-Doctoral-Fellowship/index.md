PhD student Yarin Gal wins prestigious Google Europe Doctoral Fellowship in Machine Learning. This year 15 fellowships were awarded to new doctoral students across Europe. From the ‘Research at Google’ website:

“We introduced the Google Fellowship programme in 2009 in the United States to broaden our support of university research. Universities continue to be the source of some of the most innovative research in computer science, and in particular it is the students that they foster who are the future of our field. In 2010, we extended the fellowship programme to Universities in Europe.”

[Prof Sir David MacKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._C._MacKay) was an amazing man, who until recently was part of our group. David was a terrific researcher and teacher in machine learning, and a passionate campaigner for social good through his work on energy. He passed away tragically last year.

David was a fellow at [Darwin College](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/). With help from the [Newton Trust](http://www.newtontrust.cam.ac.uk/), Darwin has established a research fellowship in David’s memory “…for research in any area drawing on mathematics and information theory, particularly those including applications in sustainability, policy or technology.”

We are delighted that Darwin has elected [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) as the first David MacKay Newton Research Fellow, to start in October.

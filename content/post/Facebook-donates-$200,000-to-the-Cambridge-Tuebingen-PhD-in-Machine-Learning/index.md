We are delighted to announce that Facebook has donated $200,000 to support our unique [Cambridge-Tuebingen PhD in Machine Learning](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=1458). The Cambridge-Tuebingen PhD Programme is a joint programme in Machine Learning between the University of Cambridge and the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tuebingen](http://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/). We received well over 100 high quality applications from around the world, interviewed about 12, and three students will be starting in the programme in October 2014: **Shixiang (Shane) Gu** studied Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, where he did his undergraduate thesis with [Geoff Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) on distributed training of neural networks. He then worked as an R&D Engineer at Panasonic Silicon Valley Lab before joining our programme. **Adam Scibior** has a BA in Computer Science from Cambridge and a BA and MSc in Physics from Posnan, and has worked on Monte Carlo methods and Probabilistic Programming. **Mateo Rojas-Carulla** received an MSc in Mathematical Engineering at Ecole Nationale des Ponts and a Distinction in Part III Mathematics at Cambridge, and has been working at Cantab Research. We are thrilled to welcome all three to our programme!

Zoubin Ghahramani has published a review article in _Nature_ on [“Probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence”](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14541.html) as part of a special issue on Machine Intelligence. This article provides an introduction to the probabilistic framework for designing machines that learn from data, and describes several areas at the frontier of the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimisation, data compression and automatic model discovery.

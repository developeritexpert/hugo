Congratulations to Richard on winning the Cambridge University Students’ Union Student-Led Teaching Award. This is an award across the entirety of Cambridge with 265 nominations.

The nomination for Richard stated that he is “a brilliant lecturer … able to explain complex ideas in very clear language that students are able to relate to … Perhaps most important, more so than his lecturing style, is his passion for engineering and teaching. Listening to his lectures makes you feel as you yourself are on a voyage of discovery through the field.”

[Alex Matthews](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=alex-matthews) has been given a software award from the Google Open Source Programs Office for his work on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The award is for “…people outside of Google that they thought were doing great things in the world of open source”, in particular for his work implementing [Cholesky backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07527). The work removes one of the main barriers to implementing Gaussian processes in TensorFlow and is part of the ongoing [GPflow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow) project.

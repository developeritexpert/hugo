date: 19 Sep 2019
---


**DEADLINE: 6 March 2015**

We are seeking up to three highly creative and motivated researchers to join the Machine Learning Group in the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, UK. Positions are available at the Senior Research Associate (SRA), Research Associate, and Research Assistant levels. All positions will involve research in direct collaboration with Professor Zoubin Ghahramani.

**Research Area 1: Building an Automatic Statistician.** This postdoc will be working on developing algorithms for the automated analysis and interpretation of statistical models. Candidates should have extensive experience in probabilistic modelling and scalable approximate inference. See: http://www.automaticstatistician.com/

**Research Area 2: Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Nonparametrics.** This postdoc will be working with Zoubin Ghahramani in collaboration with MIT and should have research experience in these two areas, ideally to include research on an existing probabilistic programming language and MCMC methods.

**Research Area 3: Inference in graphical models.** This postdoc will be working on novel approaches for inference in graphical models, including message passing and approximations of partition functions. Experience in these two areas is required.

The successful applicants will have or be near completing a PhD in computer science, information engineering, statistics or a related area, and will have extensive research experience and a strong publication record in machine learning, including ideally papers in top machine learning conferences such as NIPS, UAI, ICML, and AISTATS. SRA candidates must hold a PhD, and have several years of postdoctoral experience and well as some experience supervising projects, staff and students.

All positions are for one year in the first instance, with expectation of renewal subject to good performance and funding.

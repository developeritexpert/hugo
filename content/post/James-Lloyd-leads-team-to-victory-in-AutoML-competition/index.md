[James Lloyd](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/lloyd/) has led team backstreet.bayes to a 1st place performance in the second round of the [AutoML](http://automl.chalearn.org/) challenge. The challenge was to design machine learning methods capable of performing all model selection and parameter tuning without any human intervention.
This round of the competition required participants to submit code that would produce predictions for five new multiclass classification tasks entirely autonomously within strict time, CPU, memory and disk space constraints. Active team members include Emma Smith, Natasha Latysheva, Rowan McAllister and Alex Davies.

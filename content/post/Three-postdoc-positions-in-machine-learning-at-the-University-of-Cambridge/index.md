date: 29 Feb 2016
---



We are seeking up to three highly creative and motivated Postdoctoral Research Assistants/Associates to join the Machine Learning Group in the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, UK. All positions will involve research in direct collaboration with Professor Zoubin Ghahramani.

Post 1: Building an Automatic Statistician and Probabilistic Programming. This post holder will be working on developing algorithms for the automated analysis and interpretation of data in collaboration with MIT. Candidates should have extensive experience in probabilistic modelling, scalable approximate inference, and existing probabilistic programming languages. See: http://www.automaticstatistician.com/

Post 2: Bayesian Nonparametrics. This post holder will be working with foundations, models and inference algorithms for Bayesian Nonparametrics. Candidates should have research experience in Bayesian nonparametrics and MCMC methods.

Post 3: Deep Probabilistic Models for Making Sense of Unstructured Data. This post holder will be working on deep learning, probabilistic modelling and privacy-preserving machine learning in a collaboration between Professor Ghahramani and Professor Neil Lawrenceâ€™s group.

The successful applicants will have or be near completing a PhD in computer science, information engineering, statistics or a related area, and will have extensive research experience and a strong publication record in machine learning, including ideally papers in top machine learning conferences such as NIPS, UAI, ICML, and AISTATS.
